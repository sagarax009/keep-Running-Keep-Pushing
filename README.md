Hi Guys

'Still it's testing phase for me to get along with the hot topics like CNN,machine learning and data science'

Let me put some links for you specially I found very intresting to get proper knowledge
#first thing first
1. Follow this link to get proper knowledge of CNN (https://youtu.be/yp9rwI_LZX8), and deep understanding of concepts (http://karpathy.github.io/)
2. Trust me this is amazing tutorial and Andrej has made so simple explaination that everyone can learn CNN
3. For machine learning (https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262) this course by Udacity is so explainatory that you start to relate the giant maths behind Machine learning algorithms in simpler way
4. To start with libraries there are many like Torch,CAFFE,Tensorflow. I am using CAFFE but not so nice to see how things working . I would recommend Scikit-learn is nice to start and at deep level go with Tensorflow,yes its amazing.
5. If you are learner from text books , I encourage to go through the book Machine learning by Sebastian Raschka,it will help you get flavour of python in Machine learning
